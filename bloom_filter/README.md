# Bloom Filters - Probabilistic data structure
A data structure which is probabilistic in nature and comes in handy
in places galore.

Technically, what it does is it tests for set-membership of an element.

## Probabilistic - How?
**P.S: The word *confidence* used here is not the mathematically one -
it's a conversational one!**

This data structure returns  a **NO** with 100% confidence if something
is not present in it.

This data structure returns a **YES** with some **k** percentage
confidence if something is present in it.

## How is it different from HashMap/HashSet/Dictionary ?

Hash-function based data-structures do the same thing - and that too,
with 100% confidence! Then why do we need this anyway?



## Answering the When and Where?


## Can we rely on probability ?
