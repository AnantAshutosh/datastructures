## ProducedConsumerController.java

This contains a Producer Consumer simulation of how these two work without using 
Semaphores. Here, both the threads fill/empty the buffer and notify each other
that they are done.

This also contains a glowing example of generation of Anonymous classes. For more
reference, you can refer the [Java official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html)
and [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16880494/how-can-we-create-object-of-interface-in-java), 
both of which are interesting cases of how can we write a syntax which shows that 
an object of an interface is being created which actually creates an [anonymous class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html).
