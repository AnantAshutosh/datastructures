# Problem Solving

## Introduction
The list of problems which can come under a broad heading of problem solving are 
inserted here. 

## List of Problems

### Forward Binary Search

Given a monotonically strictly decreasing function, you have to find out the value 
at which the function starts it's negative descent. i.e. the minimum value at which 
the function returns a negative value. Here, keep in mind that you do not know the 
number of elements beforehand.

### Loop Finder

Find a loop in a given linked list. Uses O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

### Breadth First Search

Traversal of a graph using breadth first search. 

### Count Perfect Squares

Problem to count the number of perfect squares between a given range as input.

### Reach N in Min Steps (ReachNInMinJumps.java)

There is an infinite line from -INFINITY to +INFINITY. You are starting from 0.
You have to reach a given value n with minimum number of jumps such that at 
the ith step of the solution you can jump i steps either to the left or to the right.
For more information, refer the code and the url link provided at the top of that code.

### Trapped Water Problem

This problem is asked in many software developer interviews. There is a set of connected
buildings with varying heights and unit width, defined by an array of numbers. It starts 
raining heavily, and the terrace of all the buildings is filled completely with water.
You have to determine the total water stored on top of those buildings.

### Pascal Triangle

Print the pascal triangle based on a given number as input which is the number of rows
needed to print.

### Squares on Chessboard

Count the number of squares on a chessboard. Also, another variation present where 
we need to count the number of rectangles (exclude/include squares) as well.

### Sieve of Erastosthenes

A famous and old method of calculating primes until a given value n. It is a very simple
method of finding primes. 

### Queue using Stack

Implement queue data structure using Stack datastructure and methods only.

### Snake and Ladder

Calculate the minimum number of moves to reach 100 in a game of snake and ladders.

### Profit Maximization

Maximize your profit based on the condition that the following constraint holds:
profit[j] % profit[i] == 0 AND j > i where i and j are indices and profit is the 
input array.
