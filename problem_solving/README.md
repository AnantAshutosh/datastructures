## Introduction
The list of problems which can come under a broad heading of problem solving are 
inserted here. 

## List of Problems

### Forward Binary Search

Given a monotonically strictly decreasing function, you have to find out the value 
at which the function starts it's negative descent. i.e. the minimum value at which 
the function returns a negative value. Here, keep in mind that you do not know the 
number of elements beforehand.

### Loop Finder

Find a loop in a given linked list. Uses O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

### Breadth First Search

Traversal of a graph using breadth first search. 

### Count Perfect Squares

Problem to count the number of perfect squares between a given range as input.

### Reach N in Min Steps (ReachNInMinJumps.java)

There is an infinite line from -INFINITY to +INFINITY. You are starting from 0.
You have to reach a given value n with minimum number of jumps such that at 
the ith step of the solution you can jump i steps either to the left or to the right.
