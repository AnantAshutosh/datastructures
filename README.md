# Datastructures and Algorithms
Solving data-structures and algorithms problems in Java and Python. 

## Problems
Questions picked up from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org, https://www.hackerrank.com.

## Information
The programs have been divided according to data-structures as can be seen from
the packages created. Please do not use the archives folder for adding any code.

## How to run
Clone the repository using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SiddharthaAnand/datastructures.git
```
Switch directory inside the cloned directory:
```
$ cd datastructures
```
In order to run any file(BinarySearch.java), type the following command:
```
$ javac -d . BinarySearch.java
$ java arrays.BinarySearch
```
The command will create a package named arrays in your local directory and put
the class file inside that directory.
You can add the class files inside .gitignore file.

## Utilities.java
This java file contains the typical common methods that are required in almost
every code that is written in this repository. For example, taking an input,
printing on a new line or printing text along with a data-structure.

## Contribution
Feel free to refactor code, report bugs, submit pull requests or just send a suggestion.

## How to contribute
Any code that you add needs to have a proper directory name. The directory
names can be one of the following:
* name of the data-structure (arrays/)
* name of an algorithm/design paradigm (divide-and-conquer/)
