The list of problems which can come under a broad heading of problem solving are 
inserted here. 

# List of Problems
- Longest Uniform String
  Given a string, return the position and length of the substring which has largest 
  number of repeatable characters in the string.
  Example: "11100" -> [0, 3]
           "abcd"  -> [0, 1]
  Since, the largest substring with same characters is "111" which starts at position 0 and length of the substring is 3.
  In case of a tie between substrings, return the left most substring as shown in the second example.

- Break Word Problem
  This is a problem where given a dictionary of words, and an input string, you have to figure out if the string can be split into words present in the dictionary only.
  If yes, then print the words separated by space or new line. It should also print all the possible sentences the input string can be split into.
